#Sorry this one seems to be a dead end.#
This branch is a dead end as it seems not to be possible to get invalid css values from IE.
For more information read [here](https://github.com/astoilkov/jsblocks/issues/40).
If you know more or have a solution please contact me.
Otherwise if you just want to get the current version head over to the [main projekt repo](https://github.com/astoilkov/jsblocks).
